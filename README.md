## Rules
* Competitors are free to use any algorithm and evaluation function they like, so long as the computation is done on the local machine (e.g. no online API calls)
* The exception to the above rule is that exactly one move may be hardcoded. We recommend this to be the first move.
* The allowed time per move is limited to 0.5 seconds CPU time - that is, the time the CPU dedicates to running that process. This will be enforced by the driver code and you do not need to time your own algorithm. You should, however, ensure that you set the depth you will explore in accordance with this rule.
* The code for this competition will be written in Python 3.x. Participants are generally free to import any publicly available libraries so long as they do not make the task trivial. If you have any questions about this rule, please reach out to C4RC staff.
* Individuals are to submit a report detailing their method and results against provided benchmark agents. This report will be presented to the design committee.
